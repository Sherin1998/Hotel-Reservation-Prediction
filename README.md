# üè® Hotel Booking Prediction ‚Äì MLOps Certification Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine whether a hotel booking will be canceled‚Äîa critical task for hotels, as cancellations can significantly impact revenue and operational planning.  

The dataset includes features such as lead time, deposit type, special requests, and more. Key challenges include data preprocessing, feature engineering, handling missing values, and managing noisy data. Multiple models are trained, evaluated with appropriate metrics, and analyzed for feature importance to provide actionable insights.

The system predicts hotel booking outcomes, enabling **data-driven decisions for operational efficiency**.
