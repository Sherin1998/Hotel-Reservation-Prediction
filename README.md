# üè® Hotel Booking Prediction ‚Äì MLOps Certification Project

## Overview
In this project, the goal is to develop a predictive model to determine whether a hotel booking will be canceled‚Äîa critical task for hotels, as cancellations can significantly impact revenue and operational planning. The dataset includes numerous features related to bookings, such as lead time, deposit type, and special requests, which increases the complexity of the modeling process. Key challenges involve comprehensive data preprocessing, including feature selection and engineering, handling missing values, and managing data noise. Furthermore, multiple models will be trained, their performance evaluated using appropriate metrics, and insights will be drawn by analyzing the most influential features that drive hotel booking cancellations.

The system predicts hotel booking outcomes, enabling **data-driven decisions for operational efficiency**.
